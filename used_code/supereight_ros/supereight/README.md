## Project structure
supereight is made of three main components:

* `se_core`: the main header only template octree library
* `se_shared`: third party libraries and code required throughout supereight.
* `se_voxel_impl`: classes intended to be used as template parameters for the
  `se_denseslam` pipeline. These classes define the data stored in the octree
  voxels and how new measurements are integrated into the octree.
* `se_denseslam`: the volumetric SLAM pipelines presented in [1], which can be
  compiled in a library and used in external projects. Notice that the pipeline
  API exposes the discrete octree map via a `shared_ptr`. As the map is a
  template class, it needs to be instantiated correctly. This is done by setting
  the value of the `SE_VOXEL_IMPLEMENTATION` macro to the name of one of the
  classes defined in `se_voxel_impl`. By default pipelines are created for each
  of the voxel implementations defined in `se_voxel_impl`.
* `se_apps`: front-end applications which run the `se_denseslam` pipelines on
  given inputs or live camera.
* `se_tools`: related tools and scripts (e.g. for converting datasets and
  evaluating the pipeline)

## Building
### Installing the dependencies
The following packages are required to build the `se-denseslam` library:

* CMake >= 3.10
* Eigen3
* Sophus
* OpenMP (optional for improved performance)
* googletest (for unit tests)

The benchmarking and GUI apps additionally require:

* GLut
* OpenGL
* OpenNI2
* PkgConfig/Qt5
* Python/Numpy (for evaluation scripts)

To install the dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu run

``` bash
./se_tools/install_dependencies.sh
```

### Compiling
From the project root run

``` bash
make
```

### Installing
After building, supereight can be optionally installed as a system-wide library
by running

``` bash
sudo make install
```

This will also install the appropriate `supereightConfig.cmake` file so that
supereight can be used in a CMake project by adding `find_package(supereight)`.
Executables using supereight should be linked against all the libraries in
`SUPEREIGHT_CORE_LIBS` and, if the dense SLAM pipeline functionality is
desired, with ONE of the libraries in the `SUPEREIGHT_DENSESLAM_LIBS` CMake
variable.  More information about the variables defined by using
`find_package(supereight)` along with usage examples can be found in
[cmake/Config.cmake.in](cmake/Config.cmake.in).

### Running the unit tests
The unit tests use googletest. It must be compiled with the same flags as
supereight and the environment variable `GTEST_ROOT` set to the path which
contains the googletest library. To compile and run the tests, assuming
googletest was compiled in `~/googletest/googletest`, run:

``` bash
GTEST_ROOT=~/googletest/googletest make test
```

### Generating the documentation
To generate the Doxygen documentation in HTML format run

``` bash
make doc
```

Then open `doc/html/index.html` with a web browser.



## Usage example
To run one of the apps in se_apps you need to first produce an input file. We
use SLAMBench 1.0 file format (https://github.com/pamela-project/slambench).
The tool scene2raw can be used to produce an input sequence from the
[ICL-NUIM](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/VaFRIC/iclnuim.html) dataset:

``` bash
mkdir living_room_traj2_loop
cd living_room_traj2_loop
wget http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/living_room_traj2_loop.tgz
tar xzf living_room_traj2_loop.tgz
cd ..
build/se_tools/scene2raw living_room_traj2_loop living_room_traj2_loop/scene.raw
```

Then it can be used as input to one of the apps

``` bash
./build/se_apps/se-denseslam-tsdf-main -i living_room_traj2_loop/scene.raw -s 4.8 -p 0.34,0.5,0.24 -z 4 -c 2 -r 1 -k 481.2,-480,320,240  > benchmark.log
```
